# Project 3 Prep

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
Hallway is usually much longer adn connects to many different rooms. 
However, they both have doors.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of 
drawing a knight world and randomly generating a world 
using rooms and hallways?**

Answer:
yes, I can think of the black (EMPTY) tiles as rooms and the other look like long and complex 
hallways that connect everything into one system

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually 
get to the full knight world.**

Answer:

I think there are many different ways, but I think that would be helpful to write methods 
that would generate a specific structure like a room or hallways ot a given index. 
But im not sure this lab is quite hard for me to think of

**This question is open-ended. Write some classes 
and methods that might be useful for Project 3. Think 
about what helper methods and classes you used for the lab!**

Answer:

I would write some helper methods like:
buildRoom(w, h, s);
buildHallway(w, h, s);
